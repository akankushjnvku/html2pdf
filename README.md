*****How to Generate a PDF with JavaScript*****

A very common requirement for web applications is a way to generate PDFs and make them available for download. This is typically to produce invoices, tickets, sales contracts, reports, and other documents personalized with customer data.

In this article, we walk you through a simple, open-source method: html2pdf.js. html2pdf uses a JavaScript library embedded in a website to make parts of it downloadable as PDFs. For this guide, we show how to generate PDFs in a web application from an HTML template.

We also explore html2pdf.js use cases and alternatives – including an open-source React-to-PDF generator and PDFTron’s advanced JavaScript framework for dynamic, serverless generation of interactive, paginated PDF documents.
